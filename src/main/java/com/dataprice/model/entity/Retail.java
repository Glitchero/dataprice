/**
 * This entity has to be implemented in the future. 
 * This entity has to be connected with products and tasks. (And country entity is the same!).
 * The retailName and countryName have to be shown in the productsTable. The method  getCrawlingStrategy()
 * is only for keys purposes and we don't have to show that to the user.
 * This enable us to create a crawler with any name. FOr example. LiverpoolMx LiverpoolArg.
 * And we eliminate data duplication in products and tasks.
 * I would need maybe another table to do the mapping between taskname and crawlername !! IMportant
